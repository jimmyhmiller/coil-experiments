# Brainfuck read-metaprogram proof

These are raw Brainfuck files, compiled by selecting the Brainfuck reader in `src/dialects/brainfuck/`:

```sh
coil run tests/brainfuck/hello.bf --use brainfuck
printf 'reader metaprogram\n' |
  coil run tests/brainfuck/echo.bf --use brainfuck
```

The reader is also directly runnable as a code→code program — point `coil
run` at the module itself (a reader-provider registration is an entry, and a
module name resolves as a target) and the compiled Coil program prints to
stdout instead of executing:

```sh
coil run brainfuck tests/brainfuck/hello.bf   # prints the program
coil run brainfuck tests/brainfuck/hello.bf > hello.coil
coil run hello.coil                                       # Hello World!
```

The provider parses the raw bytes at compile time and emits a complete Coil
module with direct tape operations and native loops. There is no runtime opcode
interpreter, evaluator, preprocessing adapter, or `.bf` driver special case.

The tape has 30,000 wrapping `u8` cells, initially zero. Moving right past cell
29,999 exits with status 2; moving left from cell 0 exits with status 3. Cell
increment and decrement wrap modulo 256. Input stores one byte, and EOF stores
zero, so `,[.,]` terminates at EOF. Non-command bytes are comments. Unmatched
`[` and `]` are compile-time diagnostics; nesting beyond 1,024 loops is rejected.
